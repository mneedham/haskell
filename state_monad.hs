-- Example use of State monad
-- Passes a string of dictionary {a,b,c}
-- Game is to produce a number from the string.
-- By default the game is off, a C toggles the
-- game on and off. A 'a' gives +1 and a b gives -1.
-- E.g 
-- 'ab'    = 0
-- 'ca'    = 1
-- 'cabca' = 0
-- State = game is on or off & current score
--       = (Bool, Int)
